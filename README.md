# Neural-Network-Electronic-Car

Bluetooth Car: Enables car steering via Bluetooth Serial

Capturing to a Network Stream: Connects with the RPI via IP to collect
pixel arrays and Car via Bluetooth to issue commands

Compiling Training Data Files: Takes the multiple training data files
and compiles them all into a single file for easy neural network
training
